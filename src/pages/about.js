            <p>
            I am a beginning software engineer with interests focused on cloud services as well as systems programming. I am currently finishing my second degree in computer science from Oregon State University. I live in Oregon with my fiancee, Maria, and our two dogs, Laika and Olive. We enjoy spending our free time traveling and cooking. I have a large collection of board games, and I have an interest in making games of my own as well.
